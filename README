this game was planned with my partner, Shirry Tal, on August 23'. We design the game on an FPGA card.
 The purpose of the game is to achieve as many points as you can before the timer or the life remaine reaches zero.
You can lose life if the player is collied with an explosion from a bomb or mine. The mines are scattered across the screen and explode each time an explosion or a player touches it.
 The player can put one bomb on the screen when he presses the "ENTER" button, the bomb will appear in the player's position, and wait a few seconds till the explosion.
bombs can decrease the player's life count and break some walls. Some of the walls in the game can be broken into different levels (one hit / two hits / three hits).
the player gains points from exploding temp walls and mines
